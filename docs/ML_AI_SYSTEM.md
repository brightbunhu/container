## Machine Learning Algorithms

### 1. Issue Classification Algorithm

#### Algorithm Type: Naive Bayes Classifier
**Purpose**: Automatically classify ICT issues into categories based on historical data and issue descriptions.

#### Implementation Details
```typescript
class IssueClassifier {
  private issueCategories: Map<string, number>;
  private categoryProbabilities: Map<string, number>;
  private featureProbabilities: Map<string, Map<string, number>>;
}
```

#### How It Works
1. **Training Phase**:
   - Analyzes historical work logs to build probability distributions
   - Calculates prior probabilities for each issue category
   - Extracts features from issue descriptions (words, phrases)
   - Computes feature probabilities for each category

2. **Classification Phase**:
   - Tokenizes new issue descriptions into features
   - Applies Bayes theorem to calculate likelihood scores
   - Selects category with highest probability
   - Provides confidence scores and severity assessment

3. **Output Metrics**:
   - **Category**: Predicted issue type (Hardware, Software, Network, etc.)
   - **Confidence**: Statistical confidence level (0.0 - 1.0)
   - **Severity**: Risk assessment (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL)
   - **Resolution Time**: Estimated time to resolve (in hours)
   - **Priority**: Calculated priority score for scheduling

#### Mathematical Foundation
```
P(Category|Features) = P(Features|Category) × P(Category) / P(Features)

Where:
- P(Category|Features) = Posterior probability
- P(Features|Category) = Likelihood
- P(Category) = Prior probability
- P(Features) = Evidence
```

### 2. Predictive Maintenance Algorithm

#### Algorithm Type: Time Series Analysis with Pattern Recognition
**Purpose**: Predict when maintenance will be needed based on historical patterns and equipment status.

#### Implementation Details
```typescript
class MaintenancePredictor {
  private maintenanceHistory: Map<string, Date[]>;
  private failurePatterns: Map<string, number>;
}
```

#### How It Works
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Gathers maintenance history from work logs
   - Tracks time between maintenance events
   - Monitors equipment status changes
   - Records component usage patterns

2. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - Calculates average maintenance intervals
   - Identifies seasonal patterns
   - Assesses risk factors based on equipment age
   - Considers environmental factors

3. **Prediction Generation**:
   - Estimates next maintenance date
   - Calculates confidence levels
   - Assesses risk levels
   - Suggests optimal maintenance schedules

#### Risk Assessment Factors
- **Equipment Age**: Older equipment = higher risk
- **Usage Patterns**: Frequent issues = higher risk
- **Environmental Conditions**: Harsh environments = higher risk
- **Maintenance History**: Poor maintenance = higher risk

### 3. Component Recommendation Algorithm

#### Algorithm Type: Collaborative Filtering with Compatibility Scoring
**Purpose**: Recommend optimal components for repairs based on compatibility, availability, and cost-effectiveness.

#### Implementation Details
```typescript
class ComponentRecommender {
  private componentUsageMatrix: Map<string, Map<string, number>>;
  private itemComponentMatrix: Map<string, Map<string, number>>;
}
```

#### How It Works
1. **Compatibility Analysis**:
   - Checks component compatibility tags
   - Analyzes historical usage patterns
   - Considers item specifications
   - Evaluates physical constraints

2. **Scoring System**:
   - **Compatibility Score** (40%): How well component fits the item
   - **Availability Score** (30%): Stock levels and accessibility
   - **Cost-Effectiveness Score** (30%): Condition and value

3. **Recommendation Generation**:
   - Ranks components by overall score
   - Provides reasoning for each recommendation
   - Suggests alternatives if primary choice unavailable

### 4. Anomaly Detection Algorithm

#### Algorithm Type: Statistical Analysis with Z-Score and IQR Methods
**Purpose**: Detect unusual patterns in system behavior that may indicate potential issues.

#### Implementation Details
```typescript
class AnomalyDetector {
  private performanceBaselines: Map<string, { mean: number; stdDev: number }>;
  private usagePatterns: Map<string, number[]>;
}
```

#### How It Works
1. **Baseline Establishment**:
   - Calculates performance baselines for each item type
   - Establishes normal usage patterns
   - Records failure frequency distributions

2. **Anomaly Detection**:
   - **Performance Anomalies**: Resolution times outside normal range
   - **Usage Anomalies**: Unusual frequency of issues
   - **Failure Anomalies**: Unexpected failure patterns
   - **Behavior Anomalies**: Deviations from normal operation

3. **Threshold Calculation**:
   - Uses Z-score method for statistical significance
   - Implements IQR method for outlier detection
   - Provides confidence levels for each anomaly
